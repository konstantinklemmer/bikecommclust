# "Community structures, interactions and dynamics in London's bicycle sharing network" - complementary code

This repository contains the complementary code for the paper "Community structures, interactions and dynamics in London's bicycle sharing network" ([arXiv:1804.05584](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05584)). This includes the code for data preparation, processing and creation of figures (all done in R) as well as the data analysis (done using [Infomap](https://github.com/mapequation/infomap)). We also provide the generated network dataset and the output dataset (community assignment) from the community detection analysis.
